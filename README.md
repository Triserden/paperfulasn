# ASN card generators for Paperless-ngx
This project aims to generate small ASN+PATCHT cards for Paperless-ngx in case you want to use ASN stickers
without the sticker part, in case whatever entity that requires those documents
are particularly picky. (Or you just don't want stickers on your birth certificate)

Required configs are:
`PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_BARCODES=true`
`PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_ASN_BARCODE=true`

## Technologies used
- Tailwind for styling
- Shadcn/ui for components
- Next.js
- React for interactivity

Before you say it's overkill (and it is), I just really wanted to use this project as an excuse to learn.
